## Rules

##### This game is a variation on the classic game "Checkers," but unlike Checkers there are no kings. When you reach the opponents side you lose your piece, you each have 30 moves to "hop-over" your opponent's pieces while taking care to protect your own. Whoever has the most pieces after 60 turns wins! But be careful...if you play too aggressively you'll end up losing your pieces in enemy territory!
